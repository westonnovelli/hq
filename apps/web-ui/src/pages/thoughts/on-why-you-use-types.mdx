# Context

Web UIs = javascript; typescript helps you write better javascript over time, at scale.

# Take care of your future self, and your team

When you build something for a customer, a lot of what you do is for the end user.
An experienced craftsman knows when to take time to build a something that helps
him build the end product better, faster, and to a higher quality.

Types (and a compiler) are a tool to offload work to the computer, and Typescript
does that job very well, if you let it. The following are some high level thoughts
on how to leverage types for the builder's benefit (lest it not be obvious).

[insert famous quote about clearly deriving flowcharts from tables] (sic) The UI
spends most of its time transforming data in some system into a form made for humans.
In the world of React, the end result (for the interesting part of the conversation)
comes in the form of Props to your components. Start with type definitions for the
shapes that come from the system (using Graphql?, generate those types from the
schema and your queries!). This is the starting point. Then sketch out your leaf
components and the Props they will likely need. Define types for those Props. Now
you're almost done...

Joking aside, in the UI, the Types are the "tables" and the component hierarchy,
hooks (or other state/behaviors) are the flowchart. Many times, the flow becomes
obvious once you have well defined tables.

# Why do you have brakes on your car?

Someone smarter than I asked and answered this question. Hint: it is not to slow
you down. It is to enable you to go faster in a safe way. This applies to automated
testing, but you can consider Types to be the same thing, a leverage of computers
to help you build faster.
