# Context
In a traditional Computer Science  program, you'll learn ways to build
software in a "pure" sense. In the business world, constraints prevent you from 
holding to those patterns/goals. This is an exploration of how we can design a 
software system (in this case, a web UI) to be ready for the change in requirements
a business will likely serve it.

# 
Consider a portion of a large form, the user is prompted to select an item from
a list of existing things, once selected, the user can choose a set of characteristics
of that selected thing to include. The portion of interest would look something
like: 

```tsx
// form.tsx
const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState<Thing | null>(null);

return (
  <>
    <select onChange={(e) => void setChoice(e.target.value)}>
      {options.map((option) => <option key={option.id} />}
    </select>

    {Boolean(choice) && (
      <div>
         <Checkbox label="Users" />
         ...
         <Checkbox label="Rules" />
      </div>
    )}
  </>
)
```

Now, there's all sorts of ways in which you might architect this component and
the components around it. One traditionally React way would be to have a top-level
"container" that owns the state of the form and distributes values and callback
to the various children "components".

Consider the following as an implementation of that idea:

```
 /src
 │ FormContainer.tsx
 │ ThingSelect.tsx
 └ Checkbox.tsx
```

Further, the list of `Things` is data coming from a server, the container will
use a hook that fetches that data.

```tsx
const { things, loading } = useThings();
```

Now the container might look like:

```tsx
// /src/FormContainer.tsx
const { things, loading } = useThings();
const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState<Thing | null>(null);

return (
    <ThingSelect 
      options={things}
      choice={choice}
      setChoice(setChoice)
      disabled={loading}
    />
    {Boolean(choice) && (
      <div>
        <Checkbox label="Users" />
        ...
        <Checkbox label="Rules" />
      </div>
    )}
)
```

To conceptualize the checkbox selection, the details of the state is rather
arbitrary and may be informed by the server's expectations on the form submission.
I'm not convinced its relevant to this exploration. To avoid disctraction,
consider a derived value of `isUsersSelected` as a stand-in to represent the
state relevant to first checkbox.

Now, consider a new requirement, when the user has selected one of the checkboxes,
we want to display some additional context about the implications/details of that
choice. Imagine, as a first step, we want to show the number of Users the selected
Thing has which will be included. This data will need to be fetched from the server.

To continue our container/component pattern we established, FormContainer will
change to:

```tsx
// /src/FormContainer.tsx
const { things, loading } = useThings();
const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState<Thing | null>(null);

const { userCount, loadingUserCount } = useUserCount(choice.id);

return (
    <ThingSelect 
      options={things}
      choice={choice}
      setChoice(setChoice)
      disabled={loading}
    />
    {Boolean(choice) && (
      <div>
        <Checkbox label="Users" />
        ...
        <Checkbox label="Rules" />
      </div>
    )}
    {isUsersSelected && (
      <>
        {loadingUserCount && <Spinner />}
        {!loadingUserCount && (
            <span>{userCount} users will be included</span>
        )}
      </>
    )}
)
```

We might want to encapsulate the UserCount rendering into its own presentational
components (and imagine there is something equivalent for each checkbox.

```tsx
// /src/FormContainer.tsx
const { things, loading } = useThings();
const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState<Thing | null>(null);

const { userCount, loadingUserCount } = useUserCount(choice.id);
...
const { rulesCount, loadingRulesCount } = useRulesCount(choice.id);

return (
    <ThingSelect 
      options={things}
      choice={choice}
      setChoice(setChoice)
      disabled={loading}
    />
    {Boolean(choice) && (
      <div>
        <Checkbox label="Users" />
        ...
        <Checkbox label="Rules" />
      </div>
    )}
    {isUsersSelected && (
      <UserCount userCount={userCount} loading={loadingUserCount} />
    )}
    ...
    {isRulesSelected && (
      <RulesCount rulesCount={rulesCount} loading={loadingRulesCount} />
    )}
)
```

You can see that the container has expanded its scope to include the logic of
the new requirement and we've created few simple presentation components to handle
the visuals. This is in alignment with the container/component pattern and works
for this situation. The challenge begins to arise as the requirements evolve
(in a contrived way, of course) and as the scale increases.

The story continues. Now, in addition to the user count, we want the user to be
able to click on that count and see the list of user's names and emails.

Perhaps you can see how this starts to challenge the pure container/component
pattern. The pattern will still support this change, but doesn't seem to "thrive"
with it. Consider the changes required to support this change.

1. the container needs a new hook for fetching the list of users
2. the container needs a new state value for determining if the user list "modal"
is open/closed
3. new presentational component is needed to display the user list

What if that list is long and needs to be virtualized, or paginated? What if 
that list should be searchable/filterable so a user can quickly be found?

All this complexity ends up needing to be at the container level. You likely 
end up creating a few intermediary components that handle some of the specifics
that can be separated, but in the end you will have a complicated container for 
the sake of keeping your presentational components simple. You will also face a
props passing handful -I'm not one to shy from verboseness, but changesets become
challenging to review, etc when you have to pass values around- which you might 
end up reaching for a context or other tool to simplify that syntax.

None of this is to claim the container/component pattern is bad, but rather, we
have tools today that allow us to do better.

Consider an alternative. The complexity really began to present itself when we 
added the "enrichment" to the checkboxes. What happens if we let the enrichment
stay just that, an enrichment?

The "container" still resembles the sketch from before:

```tsx
// /src/FormContainer.tsx
const { things, loading } = useThings();
const [choice, setChoice] = React.useState<Thing | null>(null);

return (
    <ThingSelect 
      options={things}
      choice={choice}
      setChoice(setChoice)
      disabled={loading}
    />
    {Boolean(choice) && (
      <div>
        <Checkbox label="Users" />
        ...
        <Checkbox label="Rules" />
      </div>
    )}
    {isUsersSelected && (
      <UserCount thingId={choice.id} />
    )}
)
```

The main difference is that the `<UserCount>` component is not purely presentational,
it will do all the work it needs to itself, given a `thing` id.

```tsx
// /src/UserCount.tsx
const { userCount, loading } = useUserCount(choice.id);

if (loading) return <Spinner />;

return (
  <span>{userCount} users will be included</span>
)
```

That's not too bad. And further, as the UserCount enrichment expands in functionality
the parent form does not need to change.

```tsx
// /src/UserCount.tsx
const { userCount, loadingCount } = useUserCount(choice.id);
const { userNames, loadingNames } = useUserNames(choice.id);
const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

if (loadingNames || loadingCount) return <Spinner />;

return (
  <>
    <Button
      onClick={() => void setOpen((prev) => !prev)
    >
      {userCount} user(s) will be included
    <Button>
    {open && (
      <Dialog>
        {userNames.map(({name, email}) => (
          <span key={email}>{name} - {email}</span>
        ))}
      <Dialog>
    )}
  </>
)
```

Beyond that, as the other checkboxes in the form receive enrichments, the form
maintains a relatively simple implementation, concerning itself with primarily
the rendering and management of the form. Extended behaviors, data, and concerns
are deferred to children.

Its worth mentioning that resuse is all too often a red hering for React applications.
We all _want_ to be writing reusable components, but even if we do, how often
are they actually reused? Many times the composable parts of the component end up
being more useful. This is a big part of what made hooks so successful. The component
boundary is useful for more than just reusing wholesale, it allows for a separation
(and often a decoupling) of concerns. The UI is fundamentally a convergence of many 
concens that can otherwise be kept separate throughout the system. I think we should
pay close attention to what the concerns of the UI are per situation, rather than
assuming the traditional concerns are appropriate.
